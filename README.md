# Natural Language Processing
For NLP Analysis:
- Get the text(strings)
- Tokenize the text
- Stopwords, stemming/lemmatization
- Map tokens to integers
- Convert into CountVectors/TF-IDF
- Do ML task(recommend, detect spam, summarize, topic model...)

## NLP Algorithms
#### TF-IDF 
https://github.com/Shinuing/NLP/blob/main/Algorithms/TF-IDF%20From%20Scratch.ipynb  
Data Resourse: BBC News Text
#### Word Embeddings
https://github.com/Shinuing/NLP/blob/main/Algorithms/Word%20Embeddings.ipynb  
Method: Word2Vec
Data Resourse: GoogleNews-vectors-negative300

## NLP Applications
#### Movie Recommendataion system
https://github.com/Shinuing/NLP/tree/main/Movie%20Recommendation%20System  
Based on the movie gernes and keywords statistics to build a recommendation system and recommend the other 5 most relevant movies

- Text preprocessing and vector models
- TfidfVectorization
#### Markov Text Classifier
https://github.com/Shinuing/NLP/tree/main/Markov%20Text%20Classifier
Based on the
Data Resourse: Edgar Allen Poe and Robert Frost Poetry Collection
- Word2Idx
- Markov Model
- Condusion Matrix, F1-score
